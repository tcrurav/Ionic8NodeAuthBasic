## Getting Started

Download links:

From Github: https://github.com/tcrurav/Ionic8NodeAuthBasic.git

## Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - You can install it from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.

## General Installation instructions

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/Ionic8NodeAuthBasic.git
```

This project contains 2 different parts:
* Frontend
* Backend

You need a node.js working environment. The LTS is recommended: https://nodejs.org/es/

Once you have cloned the project install all dependencies.

```
cd Ionic8NodeAuthBasic/frontend
npm install

cd Ionic8NodeAuthBasic/backend
npm install
```

* For your backend part:
1. You need a Ionic8NodeAuthBasic/backend/.env file with a key for the JWT and the data for the connection to your MySQL Server:

```
JWT_SECRET=AVeryStrongPasswordSoThatNobodyCouldBreakIt

MYSQL_DATABASE=db_motorbikes_dev
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=sasa
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=sasa

DB_HOST=localhost

NODE_ENV=development
```

2. You need a mysql server working.

3. Create the mysql database, that in our case is "db_motorbikes_dev". You can import it from the file db_motorbikes_dev.sql included in this project. https://github.com/tcrurav/Ionic8NodeAuthBasic/blob/master/backend/db_motorbikes_dev.sql


Finally to start enjoying this project.

```
cd Ionic8NodeAuthBasic/backend
npm start

cd Ionic8NodeAuthBasic/frontend
ionic serve
```

Enjoy!!!
